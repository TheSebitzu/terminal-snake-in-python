# terminal-snake-in-python

A simple Snake game playable directly in your terminal, implemented in Python. Control the snake with your keyboard (WASD only), eat apples to grow, and try not to crash into yourself! The snake only advances when you press Enter, and wraps around the edges when it hits the wall.

## Features

- Play Snake in the terminal/command prompt
- **WASD-only** keyboard controls
- Snake advances only when you press **Enter**
- Apples (`*`) appear at random positions; eat them to grow
- Snake's body is shown with `O`, head is shown with `X`
- Snake **wraps around** the window when hitting walls
- Real-time score tracking
- Configurable play area: choose window size before you start

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/TheSebitzu/terminal-snake-in-python.git
   cd terminal-snake-in-python
   ```

2. **No external requirements:**  
   The game uses only Pythonâ€™s standard library. No need to install any extra packages.

## Usage

Run the game with:
```sh
python snake.py
```

- When prompted, input your desired window size.
- Use the **WASD** keys to set the direction for the next move.
- Press **Enter** to advance the snake by one step in the chosen direction.
- Eat apples (`*`) to grow.
- The snake's head is represented by `X`, and its body by `O`.
- **The snake wraps around the window** if it hits the wall (it appears on the opposite side).
- The game ends if you crash into yourself.
- Press `q` to quit at any time.

## How It Works

- The game draws the play area and snake in your terminal window based on your chosen size.
- The snake moves only when you press Enter, in the most recently chosen direction (WASD).
- If the snake hits the wall, it wraps around to the opposite side.
- Eating an apple (`*`) increases your score and the snake's length.
- The snake's head is shown as `X`, body as `O`.
- The game ends if the snake runs into itself.

## Limitations

- **Terminal only:** No graphical interface; runs in the terminal/command prompt.
- **WASD controls only:** Arrow keys are not supported.
- **Manual movement:** Snake only moves when you press Enter.
- **Single-player only:** No multiplayer or high score saving.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required
